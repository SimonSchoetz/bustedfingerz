# Busted Fingerz Website

This repo is to refine the Busted Fingerz website started in the orientation course in June'19 with the new knowledge about Javascipt and better understanding of html semantics.

## Brainstorm Notes

- instead of display: none -> opacity (everything gets loaded right away) (-> But then it will take up space)
- like in a  \<form action="potential link text">?does this work? (-> React apparently will fix the url thing)
- flickering BF logo casts light/shadow over the page
- custom curser made of BF logo?
- Aria-expended states for accessibility (or smth. similar)


## Plans (could be projects)

### General
- refactor general build (DONE)
- set up with sass (DONE)

### Main nav
- Figure out on a technical level (radio buttons? or as it is now with simple \<a>?) (DONE -> using \<a>)
- idea: animation, like elevating  

### Switch

- Get it working
- nice transition

    - Big switch: position: absolute;
    -> parent container needs another position than the default one
    -> at least relative or the big switch will jump all the way up
    - position: fixed -> for the side bar so it stays there all the time no matter how much content there is on the site
