# Busted Fingerz Website

This repo is to refine the Busted Fingerz website started in the orientation course in June'19 with the new knowledge about Javascipt and better understanding of html semantics.

## Plans

- Big switch: position: absolute;
-> parent container needs another position than the default one
-> at least relative or the big switch will jump all the way up

- positen: fixed for the side bar so it stays there all the time no matter how much content there is on the site
