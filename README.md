# Busted Fingerz Website

This repo is to refine the Busted Fingerz website started in the orientation course in June'19 with the new knowledge about Javascipt and better understanding of html semantics.

## Brainstorm Notes

- flickering BF logo casts light/shadow over the page
- custom curser made of BF logo?

## Plans (could be projects)

### Accessibility 

- Aria-expanded states to active menu buttons for accessibility (or smt. similar), get attribute (boolean)
- fix :focus issue probably with JS (normal :focus also applies style when clicked, not only when tabbed)

### General
- refactor general build (DONE)
- set up with sass (DONE)

### Main nav
- Figure out on a technical level (radio buttons? or as it is now with simple \<a>?) (DONE -> using \<a>)
- idea: animation, like elevating  

### Switch

- Get it working
- nice transition

    - Big switch: position: absolute;
    -> parent container needs another position than the default one
    -> at least relative or the big switch will jump all the way up
    - position: fixed -> for the side bar so it stays there all the time no matter how much content there is on the site
